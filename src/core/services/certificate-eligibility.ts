/**
 * Decides who receives a certificate, and which one.
 *
 * The rules, in the order they are applied:
 *
 *  1. Only `confirmed` registrations count. A cancelled entry earns nothing.
 *  2. Attendance is the gate. Someone who registered but never had their QR
 *     code scanned receives no certificate at all — not even participation.
 *  3. A published result sheet upgrades an attendee from `participation` to
 *     the award their entry placed for.
 *  4. For a team entry, every member who has an account receives their own
 *     certificate, carrying the team name.
 *  5. One certificate per person per event. If somebody appears in more than
 *     one entry, the strongest award wins.
 *
 * This is a pure function: no Firestore, no clock, no randomness. The data
 * layer gathers the inputs, and the Expo app in Phase 2 calls the exact same
 * code. Everything about who deserves what is decided here and nowhere else,
 * which is what makes the policy reviewable and testable in isolation.
